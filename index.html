			<h2 id="why-altsch">Why AltSchool</h2>
			<p>I am here at AltSchool to learn front-end engineering. My main motivation for choosing to learn software engineering is money. That said, I made the decision to join AltSchool after watching the video AltSchool shared on Twiiter about the Success Stories of AltSchool Alumni. It was wonderful to see that anyone can learning how to code.</p>

			<h2 id="goals">My Goals</h2>
			<p>My ultimate goal for the next one year is to devote long hours of my day to learning and practising.</p>

			<h2 id="bio">A Short Biography</h2>
			<p>My first attempt at coding was in 2015, but it was discouraging, and I concluded that it wasn't for me. I signed up for one of those session break classes. You know those ones student do during the holiday before going home like; "learn how to play the guitar," "take baking classes this holiday break," etc. Well, I signed up for a Python programming class. We were less than 10 in the class, and all students but two were completely new to coding. We were both studying humanities courses. Anyway, I quit within two weeks.</p>
